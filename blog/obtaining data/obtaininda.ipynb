    "**Curl** and **wget** are command line tools that allows you to download files from the Internet. curl and wget are installed by default on most Linux systems. if you do not have either tool installed, you can use the commands below to install curl and wget on Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   sudo apt install curl\n",
    "   sudo apt install wget\n",
    "``` \n",
    "If you are using a Mac, you can install curl and wget using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    brew install curl\n",
    "    brew install wget\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Use Curl \n",
    "\n",
    "The curl syntax is : \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl [options] [URL...] \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simpform, curl is used to download a file from the Internet without any options.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    curl example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command above will download and print the source code of the example.com homepage in your terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save the Output to a File \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than displaying to the standard output, we can use the -o option to save the output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example will save the output to a file named example.html instead of printing it to the terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -o example.html example.com # \n",
    "```\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl http://example.com --output filename\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OR\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "curl example.com -o example.html\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also redirect the output to a file using the > operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    curl -o example.com > example.html\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it’s a good idea to set the verbose mode on using -V option. This may provide useful information about the progress of the download.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\n",
    "curl -v example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "curl outputs a progress meter that shows the download rate and the expected time of completion. You can also use the -s option to hide the progress meter and the progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -s example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Following Redirects \n",
    "\n",
    "When accessing shortened URL with curl, such as: http://bit.ly/, we need to set the -L option to automatically follow redirects\n",

    "```\n",

    "#### Using Curl to Download from FTP server\n",
    "\n",
    "Curl has over 20 built-in FTP commands. You can use curl to download files from FTP servers as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "curl -s \"ftp://ftp.gnu.org/welcome.msg\" | trim\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### How to use Wget Command \n",
    "\n",
    "The wget command is similar to curl, but it does not print the output to the terminal. Instead, it saves the output to a file. Its syntax is shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget [options] [URL...]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download a file from the Internet using wget and saved to a file with same name. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also save the output to a diffrent file name using the -O option.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O example.html example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    wget -P /home/example.com example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Difference between Wget and Curl \n",
    "\n",
    "Wget is similar to Curl, but curl is more powerful. wget is a tool to download files from servers\n",
    "while curl is a tool that let's you exchange requests/responses with a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "wget's major advantage is its ability to download recursively. Wget is command line only. There's no library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curl is powered by libcurl - a cross-platform library with a stable API that can be used by each and everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Curl is generally preferred since it supports more features than wget. For comparison [here](https://curl.se/docs/comparison-table.html) is the list of features of available with different tools:\n",
