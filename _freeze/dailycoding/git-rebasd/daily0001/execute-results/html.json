Thus, you can't fast-forward into it (because fast-forward requires your branch to completely contain the destination branch).\n\n\nSolution that works for me is from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13106179/fatal-not-possible-to-fast-forward-aborting)\n\n\n\n```{bash}\ngit pull --rebase\n\n```\n\n\n\n<style>\nbody {\ntext-align: justify}\n</style>\n\n",
