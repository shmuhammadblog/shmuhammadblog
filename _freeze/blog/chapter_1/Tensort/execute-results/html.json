It is dynamic graph-based framework that allows you to define your neural network in a way that is easy to understand and debug. Today, PyTorch is the [most used deep learning framework](https://paperswithcode.com/trends) and mostly use by researchers and engineers.  \n\n\n![](./pytorch_most_used.png)\n\n\nPyTorch support GPU acceleration (making your code run faster) behind the scenes, better than NumPy. PyTorch also provides Autograd for automatic differentiation, which means that your code is automatically differentiated and you can use it to do backpropagation\n\n\n## Pytoch Installation\n\nBefore you installed Pytorch, you need to install the following dependencies: Package Manager (e.g. pip, conda), Python, Numpy. For more information, please refer to the [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/).\n\nFor me, I am using mac and conda as package manager, I therefore  run the following command\n\n\n## VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify your installation works, \n\n\n```{}\nimport torch\ntorch.manual_seed(1234)\ntorch.__version__\n```\n\n\n## What is Tensor \n\n- Assume we have 3 bedrooms, 1 carpark and 2 bathrooms. We can represent this data numerically in a form of vector [3, 1,2] to describe bedrooms, carpark and bathrooms\n\n- Tensor are the standard way of representing data in Pytorch, such as text, images, and audio. Their job is to represent data in a numerical way. \n\n![](./tensor_represent_data.png)\n\n\n![](./tensor_loop.png)\n\n\n\n\n## is Tensor all you need? \n\n- There are many Python Data Structure for holding data including Python List and Numpy Array. List and Numpy Array operations are similar to Pytorch Tensor.\n  \n- Let us remember the basic of data structures in Python (List and Numpy Array) before we start using Pytorch Tensor\n\n\n## From Python lists to Numpy Array\n\n - Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na_list = [1,3,4] #A list is the Python equivalent of an array\na_list\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n[1, 3, 4]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
