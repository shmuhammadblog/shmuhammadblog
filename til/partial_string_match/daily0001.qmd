## Partial String Matching

So, I want to do string partial matching in a dataframe. The first image shows a dataframe with two columns and two rows. Both the  columns contains text with partial matching in another one. So, I want create a dataframe where the partial match are arrange in the same row. 


```{r}
1+1
```


```{}

df <- data.frame (first_column  = c("The dog is missing", "We found it"),
                  second_column = c("we found the cat", "The dog  missing")                  )
```
