## Labelled vs labelled

I often forget which one to use between labeled and labelled.

Labeled is an American spelling while labelled is British spelling.

I use labelled since I write in British English.


## Focus vs focused

There is a rule in the English language called the doubling up rule. Basically, if you add a vowel suffix to the end of a word, you typically want to double up the final letter to allow room for it. 

The official requirements are that we ‘double a single consonant letter at the end of any base where the preceding vowel is spelled with a single letter and stressed’. For example: (bar, barring, barred), (beg, begging, begged), (occur, occurring, occurred). 

However, no doubling when the preceding vowel is unstressed. For example: panic becomes panicking, traffic becomes trafficking, 

Now is focus or focussing?

> This word can take either double or single s, with the single option being highly preferred.

focusing/focussing	and focused/focussed are all correct. !
