## Why this problem?

This happens is your branch is no longer directly based off of the branch you're trying to merge it into - e.g. another commit was added to the destination branch that isn't in your branch. Thus, you can't fast-forward into it (because fast-forward requires your branch to completely contain the destination branch).


Solution that works for me is from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13106179/fatal-not-possible-to-fast-forward-aborting)


```{bash}
git pull --rebase

```
